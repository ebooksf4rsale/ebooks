    <h2>INNERCISE: The New Science to Unlock Your Brain’s Hidden Power</h2>
    <p>by John Assaraf (Author)  </p>
   
    <hr>
    <p>In the 1950s and í60s, Jack LaLanne revolutionized the physical fitness and health industry by promoting and teaching exercise and nutrition.</p>
    <p>Today, we complete the fitness revolution with Innerciseóa comprehensive guide to science-based mental and emotional techniques to strengthen your mindset and unleash the hidden power of your brain.</p>
    <p>Lack of knowledge or skill is not what really holds you back. Itís your mindset, emotional blocks, and deeply ingrained habits that you must release to clear the path to your greatest victories and successes. With Innercise, youíll learn to change your habitual patterns, and eliminate disempowering emotions like:</p>
    <p>
        <ul class="nobullets">
            <li>Fear of failure or success</li>
            <li>Fear of being ashamed, embarrassed or judged</li>
            <li>Low self-worth and self-esteem</li>
            <li>Negativity and pessimism</li>
            <li>Lack of confidence and certainty</li>
            <li>Fear of disappointing yourself or others</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Your limiting beliefs, stories, traumas and excuses are nothing more than reinforced subconscious patterns that cause you to think, feel, and consistently behave in ways that produce the same results again and again.</p>
    <p>Now, cutting-edge technology and the science of neuroplasticity have finally unlocked the door to breaking free from these patterns. My hope in writing this book is that it will empower you to recognize and release whatever is holding you back from your fullest potential and the grandest vision for your life.</p>
    <h3>In this book you will discover how to:</h3>
    <p>
        <ul class="nobullets">
            <li>Recognize and release any mental or emotional obstacle that is holding you back from achieving your biggest goals and dreams</li>
            <li>Increase your self-confidence and self-worth</li>
            <li>Train your brain to focus on exactly how you will achieve your goals versus why you can't</li>
            <li>Eliminate any inner block, such as fear of failing, embarrassment, shame, or judgment</li>
            <li>Enjoy life with greater significance, purpose, and meaning</li>
            <li>Turn any fear into fuel for success</li>
            <li>Remove self-doubt and gain more certainty</li>
            <li>Acquire more self-discipline and develop empowering habits</li>
            <li>Strengthen your mindset and become unstoppable.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Who is this book for?</h3>
    <p>This book is for the individual who knows they are capable of achieving more wealth, greater health and business or career success yet for some reason, they haven't yet cracked the code to unlocking their fullest abilities and skills.</p>
    <p>If you've read books, attended seminars and gained lots of great information and still haven't reached your lifeís biggest goals and dreams, this book will help you shatter the mental and emotional constraints that have held you back from living the life you imagine.</p>
    <p>If you have a job you want to leave, or a business you want to start or grow, this book will help you break free and do what will give you the greatest purpose and meaning in your life.</p>
    <p>If you want to get healthier, happier, more focused and aligned with your greatest strengths and passions, this book will ignite the genius within you.</p>
    <p>If you've ever caught yourself thinking and feeling that you are not smart enough, good enough or worthy of success, this book will help you release those debilitating thoughts and emotions.</p>
    <p>If you've ever been afraid of failing or disappointing yourself or loved ones, this book will give you the tools to train your brain and feel the most empowered, confident and certain you have ever felt.</p>
