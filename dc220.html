    <h2>Never Be Closing: How to Sell Better Without Screwing Your Clients, Your Colleagues, or Yourself</h2>
    <p>Tim Hurson (Author), Tim Dunne (Author)</p>
   
    <hr>
    <p>Everyone knows that the first rule of sales is “always be closing”. But what if the less time you spend trying to close, the more time you can devote to helping people solve problems and seize opportunities? And what if following the new rule of sales, “always be useful”, results in more business? If you sell and if you aim to sell better, you need to know about the stranger’s dilemma. A stranger doesn’t have the leverage of instant credibility. So it’s not surprising that a wide range of sales tactics, tools, and closing techniques have been developed as a substitute for credibility. Their purpose is often to wrangle a commitment to buy, even when buying may not be in the best interests of the client. The approach advocated in <span>Never Be Closing</span> is designed to overcome the stranger’s dilemma, but in a very different way.</p>
    <p>This book is a comprehensive strategy that starts with a well-researched process for identifying and solving problems. It shows you how to access your creativity to establish and maintain relationships that will be truly useful for both you and your clients over time. In a very real sense, this book will show you how to become less of a stranger. <span>Never Be Closing</span> expands on the principles of Tim Hurson’s first audiobook, <span>Think Better</span>, by offering a simple and repeatable Productive Selling framework to make the most of new opportunities. From getting your foot in the door to delivering the perfect sales pitch to debriefing after a meeting, Hurson and Dunne have an all-encompassing plan to improve your sales results, including: Eight Paths to Credibility, proven methods that establish your authority to ask key questions that reveal your client’s issues, challenges, and goals. Q-Notes, a powerful strategy to make your notes doubly useful - to both record and guide your sales meeting. Three-Act Structure, a creative way to design the sales conversation to explore client needs, offer solutions, and deliver value.</p>
