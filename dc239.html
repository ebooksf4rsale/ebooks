    <h2>Practicing the Power of Now: Essential Teachings, Meditations, and Exercises from the Power of Now</h2>
    <p>by Eckart Tolle (Author) </p>
   
    <hr>
    <h3>New York Times bestselling author Eckhart Tolle — A key to happiness is living in the now</h3>
    <p><span>Practice The Power of Now</span>: If you, like many others, have benefited from the transformative experience of reading <span class="two">The Power of Now</span>, you will want to own and read <span class="two">Practicing the Power of Now</span>.</p>
    <p><span>Eckhart Tolle</span>: Eckhart Tolle, a spiritual teacher and author who was born in Germany and educated at the Universities of London and Cambridge, is rapidly emerging as one of the world’s most inspiring spiritual teachers. His views go beyond any particular religion, doctrine, or guru. In <span class="two">The Power of Now </span>and his subsequent book <span class="two">Practicing the Power of Now</span>, Eckhart shares the enlightenment he himself experienced after a profound inner transformation radically changed the course of his life.</p>
    <p><span>Your path to enlightenment</span>: <span class="two">Practicing the Power of Now</span> extracts the essence from Eckhart’s teachings in his New York Times bestseller, <span class="two">The Power of Now</span> (translated into 33 languages). <span class="two">Practicing the Power of Now</span> shows us how to free ourselves from “enslavement to the mind.” The aim is to be able to enter into and sustain an awakened state of consciousness throughout everyday life. Through meditations and simple techniques, Eckhart shows us how to quiet our thoughts, see the world in the present moment, and find a path to “a life of grace, ease, and lightness.”</p>
    <p><span>The next step in human evolution</span>: Eckhart’s profound yet simple teachings have already helped countless people throughout the world find inner peace and greater fulfillment in their lives. At the core of the teachings lies the transformation of consciousness, a spiritual awakening that he sees as the next step in human evolution. An essential aspect of this awakening involves transcending our ego-based state of consciousness. This is a prerequisite not only for personal happiness but also for the ending of violence on our planet.</p>
    <p>Readers of other transformational self-help books such as <span class="two">The Four Agreements, The Miracle Morning, Braving the Wilderness</span>, and <span class="two">The Book of Joy</span> will want to read Practicing the Power of Now.</p>
