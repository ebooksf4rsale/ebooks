    <h2>Imagine It Forward: Courage, Creativity, and the Power of Change</h2>
    <p>by Beth Comstock (Author), Tahl Raz (Author)  </p>
   
    <hr>
    <h3>FROM ONE OF TODAY'S FOREMOST INNOVATION LEADERS, AN INSPIRING, PERSONAL APPROACH TO MASTERING CHANGE IN THE FACE OF UNCERTAINTY.</h3>
    <h3>NAMED A 2018 BEST BUSINESS BOOK PICK BY FAST COMPANY AND WIRED UK.</h3>
    <p>Confronting change is incredibly hard, both organizationally and personally. People become resistant. They are afraid. Yet the pace of change in our world will never be slower than it is right now, says Beth Comstock, the former Vice Chair and head of marketing and innovation at GE.</p>
    <p>Imagine It Forward is an inspiring, fresh, candid, and deeply personal book about how tograpple with the challenges to change we face every day.It is a different kind of narrative, a big picture book that combines Comstock's personal story in leading change with vital lessons on overcoming the inevitable roadblocks. One of the most successful women in business, Comstock shares her own transformation story from introverted publicist to GE's first woman Vice Chair, and her hard-won lessons in shifting GE, a 125 year old American institution, toward a new digital future and a more innovative culture. 
        As the woman who initiated GE's Ecomagination clean-energy and its (and NBC's) digital transformations, Comstock challenged a global organization to not wait for perfection, but to seek out emerging trends, embrace smart risks and test ideas boldly, and often. She shows how each one of us can become a “change maker” by leading with imagination. </p>
    <h3>“Ideas are rarely the problem,” writes Comstock.  “What holds all of us back, really—is fear. It's the attachment to the old, to "What We Know."</h3>
   
    <p>As Comstock makes clear, transforming the mindset and culture of a company is messy. There is no easy checklist. It is fraught with uncertainty, tension and too often failure. It calls for the courage to defy convention, go around corporate gatekeepers when necessary, and reinvent what is possible. </p>
    <p>For all those looking to spearhead change in their companies and careers, and reinvent “the way things are done,” Imagine It Forward masterfully points the way.</p>
